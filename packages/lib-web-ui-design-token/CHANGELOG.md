# @designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ace98d: ## Design Token Pipeline
  - **What changed?**
    - 1. Migrated the token source into the core package under Style Dictionary v5.
    - 2. Added the multi-stage build (font download, per-theme CSS/JS bundles, flattened TypeScript
         themes).
    - 3. Introduced runtime validators to guard token integrity.
  - **Why does it matter?**
    - 1. Consolidates all token outputs into a single, consumable package.
    - 2. Provides typed accessors and ready-to-use theme assets for downstream apps.
    - 3. Catches regressions early through automated validation.
  - **What's next?**
    - 1. Resolve Style Dictionary naming collisions surfaced during the build.
    - 2. Broaden semantic token coverage now that the pipeline is stable.
    - 3. Publish consumption guides for app teams targeting Tailwind and CSS variables.
