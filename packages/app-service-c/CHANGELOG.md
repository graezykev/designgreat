# @designgreat/app-service-c

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-service-c
  - Scaffolded the package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with ready-made build, test, lint, and
    typecheck flows.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Hooked into repo automation (husky, commitlint, changeset) so the service follows the same
    delivery pipeline.
