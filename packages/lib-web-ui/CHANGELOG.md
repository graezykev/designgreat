# @designgreat/lib-web-ui

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/lib-web-ui
  - Scaffolded the UI library in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and typecheck
    tasks ready.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Wired repo automation so component work benefits from the same delivery pipeline as the apps.
