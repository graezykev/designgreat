# @designgreat/eslint-config

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/eslint-config
  - Added the eslint-config package to the pnpm/Turborepo workspace so consumers can share lint
    rules immediately.
  - Applied the repo's new TypeScript build setup and validation flow to the configuration package.
  - Connected automation and release tooling so future lint rule updates publish smoothly.
