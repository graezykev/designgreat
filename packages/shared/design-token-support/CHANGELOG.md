### Minor Changes

- 5ace98d: ## Design Token Support Alignment
  - **What changed?**
    - 1. Pointed the helpers at the regenerated token outputs.
    - 2. Refreshed CSS-variable generation utilities to match the new structure.
    - 3. Added alignment tests to keep Tailwind integrations in sync.
  - **Why does it matter?**
    - 1. Ensures consumers continue to receive accurate token-derived styles.
    - 2. Reduces drift between runtime helpers and the core token package.
    - 3. Protects against regressions as the token pipeline evolves.
  - **What's next?**
    - 1. Ship utilities for dynamic theme loading in client apps.
    - 2. Document advanced usage patterns for Tailwind v4 and SSR.
    - 3. Track downstream adoption and gather feedback for additional helpers.
