# @designgreat/shared

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/shared
  - Scaffolded the shared utilities package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint,
    and typecheck flows ready.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Hooked repo automation so shared code evolves alongside the rest of the monorepo without
    friction.
