### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-web-pc-core
  - Scaffolded the package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and typecheck
    flows prepared.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Connected the package to repo automation to ensure core desktop logic ships with the same
    guardrails.
