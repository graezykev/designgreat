# @designgreat/app-web-mobile-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-web-mobile-core
  - Scaffolded the mobile core package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace and aligned build, test,
    lint, and typecheck routines.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Wired repo automation so UI work inherits the same quality gates as the rest of the monorepo.
