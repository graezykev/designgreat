# @designgreat/lib-web-ui-website

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/lib-web-ui-website
  - Scaffolded the website package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and
    typecheck routines ready.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Wired repo automation so site updates flow through the same guardrails as the rest of the stack.
