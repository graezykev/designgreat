# @designgreat/app-service-serverless-a

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-service-serverless-a
  - Scaffolded the serverless package inside the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint,
    and typecheck tasks wired up.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Connected the package to repo automation so deployment tooling stays aligned with the rest of
    the services.
