# Design Token Guides

This guide explains how to consume design tokens from `@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token` in your application.

## What Are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. They're used in place of hard-coded values to ensure consistency and maintainability across your application.

## Package Overview

`@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token` provides:

- **TypeScript Runtime APIs** — Strongly typed helpers for themes and tokens
- **CSS Variables** — Generated CSS with theme variables for light and dark modes
- **Font Assets** — Font-face definitions and font files (Space Grotesk family)
- **Theme Support** — Light and dark themes with runtime switching utilities

## Key Features

- ✅ Built-in light and dark themes
- ✅ CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript outputs
- ✅ Type-safe token access with full IntelliSense
- ✅ Runtime theme switching utilities
- ✅ Self-contained font assets (no CDN required)
- ✅ Framework agnostic (works with Next.js, Vite, CRA, etc.)
