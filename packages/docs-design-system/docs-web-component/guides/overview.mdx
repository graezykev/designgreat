# Web Component Guides

This guide explains how to consume the `@designgreat/lib-web-ui` React component library in your application.

:::note Terminology
Despite the name "Web Components", this library provides **React components**, not browser-native [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components). The name refers to components designed for web applications.
:::

## What Are These Components?

The components in this library are pre-built React UI primitives (Button, TextInput, Dialog) that implement the Design Great design system. They provide consistent styling, accessibility features, and theme support out of the box.

`@designgreat/lib-web-ui` provides:

- **React Components** — Button, TextInput, Dialog with full TypeScript support
- **Design Tokens** — CSS variables from `@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token`
- **Tailwind Utilities** — Token-aware utility classes for custom UIs
- **Component Styles** — Pre-built styles with automatic theme support
- **TypeScript Definitions** — Fully typed component props and events

## Key Features

- ✅ Built-in theme support (light/dark)
- ✅ Accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- ✅ TypeScript definitions with IntelliSense
- ✅ Tailwind CSS integration for customization
- ✅ Design token utilities for consistent styling
