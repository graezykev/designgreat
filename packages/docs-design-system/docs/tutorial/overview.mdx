# Design Tokens Guide

This guide explains how to consume design tokens from `@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token` in your application.

## What Are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. They're used in place of hard-coded values to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Package Overview

`@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token` provides:

- **TypeScript Runtime APIs** - Strongly typed helpers for themes and tokens
- **CSS Variables** - Generated CSS with theme variables
- **Font Assets** - Font-face definitions and font files
- **Theme Support** - Light and dark themes out of the box

## Quick Links
