# Contributing Docs Convention

This guide establishes conventions for writing **contributing documentation** — guides that help developers **contribute** to a package.

## Scope

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | How to _contribute_ to a package |
| **Audience** | Package developers (contributors to the codebase) |
| **Location** | `/contributing/[package]-development/` |
| **Focus** | Setup, architecture, workflows, testing |

---

## Folder Structure

### Standard Folders

```
docs-contributing/
├── index.mdx                          # Contributing overview
├── conventions/                       # Documentation conventions
│   ├── integration-docs-convention.mdx
│   └── contributing-docs-convention.mdx
├── design-token-development/          # Package-specific guides
│   ├── overview.mdx
│   ├── get-started.mdx
│   ├── architecture.mdx
│   └── ...
└── web-component-development/
    ├── overview.mdx
    ├── get-started.mdx
    ├── architecture.mdx
    └── ...
```

### Standard File Order (Progressive)

| Position | File | Purpose | User Journey |
|----------|------|---------|--------------|
| 0 | overview.mdx | What & Why | "What is this package?" |
| 1 | get-started.mdx | Quick setup | "How do I set up?" |
| 2 | architecture.mdx | How it works | "How is it structured?" |
| 3 | `[core-dev-workflow]`.mdx | Main dev activity | "How do I work day-to-day?" |
| 4 | `[specialized]`.mdx | Deep dive | "What about advanced topics?" |
| 5 | `[build, integration]`.mdx | Build & integration | "How are artifacts generated?" |
| 6 | `[testing, quality, checking]`.mdx | Testing & quality | "How do I test?" |
| 7 | `[release, publish, deploy]`.mdx | Release & deployment | "How do I release?" |
| 8 | troubleshooting.mdx | Debug | "Something's wrong" |

:::note Flexibility
This is a **guideline**, not strict rules. Adapt based on package needs:

- **Skip files** — Not every package needs `architecture.mdx` or `troubleshooting.mdx`
- **Merge files** — Combine related topics (e.g., `quality-check-build-deploy.mdx`)
- **Separate files** - For more complex explanation you can have both `testing.mdx` and `quality.mdx`, etc.
- **Add files** — Insert specialized docs where they make sense
- **Reorder** — Adjust positions if it improves the user journey

The goal is a **logical, progressive flow** — not rigid conformity.

### Package-Specific Files

| Position | design-token-development | web-component-development |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 3 | token-authoring.mdx | storybook-workflow.mdx |
| 4 | font-assets.mdx | font-handling.mdx |
| 5 | build-system.mdx | design-token-integration.mdx |
| 6 | testing-validation.mdx | testing.mdx |
| 7 | publishing.mdx | publishing.mdx |
| 8 | troubleshooting.mdx | troubleshooting.mdx |

---

## URL Naming

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Folder | `[package]-development/` | `/contributing/design-token-development/` |
| Files | lowercase, hyphenated | `get-started`, `token-authoring` |
| Sidebar ID | `contributingSidebar` | — |

### Naming Rules

- ✅ Use `[package]-development` for folder names
- ✅ Use lowercase with hyphens for file names
- ✅ Match file names to content focus
- ❌ Avoid generic names (`guide.mdx`, `docs.mdx`)

## Common Page Types

### get-started.mdx

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Prerequisites | Link to shared setup |
| Package Location | Filesystem path to the package |
| Development Commands | Dev server, watch mode (no lint/test) |
| Next Steps | Link to architecture, workflow, testing |

:::note
Lint, typecheck, and test commands belong in **testing.mdx** (position 7), not get-started.
:::

### architecture.mdx

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Project Structure | Directory tree with descriptions |
| Key Files | Important files explained |
| Data Flow | How data moves through the system |
| Design Decisions | Why things are the way they are |
| Next Steps | Link to core workflow |

### publishing.mdx

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Before Opening a PR | Checklist: build, local checks, update docs, create changeset |
| CI Pipeline | On Every PR (mermaid + table), On Merge to Main (mermaid), workflow file links |
| Package Distribution | For npm packages: exports table, published files |
| Deployment | For non-npm (e.g., docs site): deployment targets, features |
| Next Steps | Links to changeset workflow, testing, troubleshooting |

:::note
- **npm packages** use "Package Distribution" (exports, published files)
- **Non-npm packages** (like docs site) use "Deployment" (GitHub Pages, etc.)
- Always include mermaid diagrams for CI pipelines
- Always link to workflow files with 📄 prefix
:::

### troubleshooting.mdx

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Common Issues | Problem → Solution pairs |
| Debug Commands | Useful diagnostic commands |
| Getting Help | Where to ask questions |
| Next Steps | Links to related docs |

## Singular vs Plural

**The noun (subject) determines singular/plural; modifiers stay singular.**

| Example | Modifier | Noun | Result |
|---------|----------|------|--------|
| Design Token Development | Design Token | Development (uncountable) | ✅ Singular noun |
| Font Assets | Font | Assets (multiple) | ✅ Plural noun |
| Testing | — | Testing (uncountable) | ✅ Singular noun |
