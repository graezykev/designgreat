# Component Library Development

This section covers the development workflow, architecture, and guidelines for working with the `@designgreat/lib-web-ui` component library package.

## About This Package

`@designgreat/lib-web-ui` is a React component library built with design tokens from `@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token`. This package provides:

- **React Components** – Button, TextInput, Dialog with full TypeScript support
- **Design Token Integration** – CSS variables generated from design tokens
- **Tailwind Utilities** – Token-aware utility classes for custom UIs
- **Component Styles** – Handcrafted styles for each component
- **Storybook Documentation** – Interactive demos and development environment

## For Consumers vs Developers

This section is for **developers working on the component library itself**. If you're looking to **use** the component library in your application, see the [Component Library Usage Guide](/components/guides/overview).
