# Web Component Development

This section covers the development workflow, architecture, and guidelines for contributing to the `@designgreat/lib-web-component` component library package.

## About This Package

`@designgreat/lib-web-component` is Design Great's React component library built with design tokens. This package provides:

- **React Components** — Button, TextInput, Dialog with full TypeScript support
- **Design Token Integration** — CSS variables generated from design tokens
- **Tailwind Utilities** — Token-aware utility classes for custom UIs
- **Component Styles** — Handcrafted styles for each component
- **Storybook Documentation** — Interactive demos and development environment

:::info Naming Clarification
Despite the package name `lib-web-component`, this is a **React component library** — not browser [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM). The name refers to "components for the web" rather than the Web Components API.

## For Consumers vs Contributors

This section is for **contributors working on the component library itself**. If you want to **use** the component library in your application, see the [Web Component Guides](/web-component/guides/overview).
