# Get Started

Get started contributing to the component library package quickly.

:::info Initial Setup
Complete the [shared setup steps](/contributing#getting-started) first (clone, install, build).
:::

## Package Location

The component library package is located at:

```
packages/lib-web-component/
```

## Development Commands

### Local Development (Storybook)

Start Storybook development server (recommended):

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-web-component storybook
```

Opens at `http://localhost:6006`

**What happens:**
1. Vite-powered Storybook server starts
2. Design tokens are imported directly from `@designgreat/lib-design-token`
3. Tailwind JIT generates utilities on-demand
4. Theme switcher toolbar allows testing light/dark themes

### Other Development Commands

Component development without Storybook:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-web-component dev
```
