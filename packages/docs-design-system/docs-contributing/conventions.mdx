# Documentation Conventions

This guide establishes standardized conventions for writing overview documentation in the Design Great documentation site. Following these conventions ensures consistency across all documentation.

## Two Documentation Types

The documentation site contains two distinct types of documentation:

| Type | Purpose | Audience | Location |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Integration Docs** | How to _use_ a package in your application | Package consumers | `/design-token/`, `/web-component/` |
| **Development Docs** | How to _contribute_ to a package | Package developers | `/contributing/` |

---

## Folder and URL Naming

Use consistent naming across folder names, URL paths, and sidebar IDs:

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Integration doc folders | `guides/` | `/design-token/guides/`, `/web-component/guides/` |
| Development doc folders | `{package}-development/` | `/contributing/design-token-development/` |
| Sidebar IDs | `{section}Sidebar` | `guidesSidebar`, `componentsSidebar`, `contributingSidebar` |

### Naming Rules

- ✅ Use `guides` (not `tutorial`) for integration documentation folders
- ✅ Use lowercase with hyphens for folder names
- ✅ Use consistent sidebar ID naming: `guidesSidebar`, not `tutorialSidebar`
- ✅ URL paths should match folder structure

### Singular vs Plural

**The noun (subject) determines singular/plural; modifiers stay singular** — like adjectives in English.

| Context | Rule | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Modifiers** (like adjectives) | Singular | "Design Token", "Web Component", "Color Token" |
| **Nouns** (the subject) | Match meaning | "Guides" (multiple), "Development" (uncountable) |
| Navbar labels | Singular | "Design Token", "Web Component" |

**Pattern: `[Singular Modifier] + [Noun matching meaning]`**

| Example | Modifier | Noun | Result |
|---------|----------|------|--------|
| Design Token Guides | Design Token | Guides (multiple) | ✅ Plural noun |
| Base Colors | Base | Colors (multiple) | ✅ Plural noun |
| Design Token Development | Design Token | Development (uncountable) | ✅ Singular noun |
| Font Assets | Font | Assets (multiple) | ✅ Plural noun |
| Installation | — | Installation (single action) | ✅ Singular noun |

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Design Token Guides" (Guides is the noun, plural)
- ✅ "Base Colors" (Colors is the noun, plural)
- ✅ "Design Token Development" (Development is uncountable)
- ❌ "Design Tokens Guides" (modifier should be singular)
- ❌ "Base Color" (noun should be plural when referring to multiple items)

## Integration Docs Convention

Integration documentation helps consumers understand and use a package. Use this template for overview pages in `/design-token/` and `/web-component/`.

### Required Sections (in order)

```markdown
# {Package Name} Guides

{One-sentence description of what these guides cover.}

## What Are {Concept}?

{Brief explanation of the core concept for newcomers. 2-3 sentences.}

## Package Overview

{Package name} provides:

- **Feature 1** — Description
- **Feature 2** — Description

## Key Features

- ✅ **Feature name** — Benefit description
- ✅ **Feature name** — Benefit description

## Learning Path (Optional)

{Table with Time, Goal, Guide columns — see Format Options below}

## In This Section

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

## Related Resources

- [Link](/path) — Brief description

## Contributing

To contribute to this package, see the [{Package} Development Guides](/contributing/path).

## Next Steps

{Table, bullets, or plain text — see Format Options below}
```

:::tip Alternative Formats
See [Format Options](#format-options) below for:
- **Package Exports** table format (for packages with multiple import paths)
- **Learning Path** table format (for guides with 5+ sub-pages)
:::

### Section Guidelines

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title | ✅ | "`{Package Name}` Guides" |
| Intro paragraph | ✅ | One sentence explaining the guide's purpose |
| What Are X? | ✅ | Explain core concept for newcomers |
| Package Overview/Exports | ✅ | What the package provides (bullet list or table) |
| Key Features | ✅ | Checklist with **bold labels** and benefit descriptions |
| Learning Path | ⚪ Optional | Ordered guide navigation for docs with 5+ sub-pages |
| In This Section | ✅ | DocCardList showing child pages |
| Related Resources | ✅ | Links to related guides and external resources |
| Contributing | ✅ | Single link to development guide |
| Next Steps | ✅ | Guided navigation to next relevant topics |

### Format Options

#### Package Overview vs Package Exports

Use the format that best fits your content:

| Format | Heading | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Bullet list** | "Package Overview" | General capabilities, no specific import paths |
| **Table** | "Package Exports" | Multiple distinct import paths (CSS, JS, fonts, etc.) |

**Example: Package Exports table**

| Export | Import Path | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **CSS Variables** | `@pkg/css` | Web styling with `var(--dg-*)` |
| **TypeScript APIs** | `@pkg` | Runtime token access |
| **Font Assets** | `@pkg/font` | Self-hosted fonts |

#### Key Features Format

Use **bold labels** followed by descriptions for scannability:

```markdown
- ✅ **Light & dark themes** — Built-in, ready to use
- ✅ **Type-safe** — Full IntelliSense for all token paths
- ✅ **React Native compatible** — JS exports work in StyleSheet
```

#### Learning Path (Optional)

Include when your guide section has **5 or more sub-pages** to help users navigate:

- Use time estimates for tutorials (e.g., "2 min", "10 min")
- Use "Reference" for lookup-style documentation
- Order from beginner to advanced

**Example: Learning Path table**

| Time | Goal | Guide |
|------|------|-------|
| **2 min** | Get started | Quick Start |
| **5 min** | Learn basics | Basic Usage |
| **10 min** | Add theming | Theming |
| **Reference** | Look up APIs | API Reference |

*Note: In actual docs, the Guide column contains relative links like `[Quick Start](./quick-start)`.*

#### Next Steps Format

End each guide page with a "Next Steps" section. Use the format that matches the context:

| Context | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Quick Start** | Table | Multiple paths for users to choose |
| **Single next step** | Plain text | `Continue with [X](./x) to learn...` |
| **Multiple options** | Bullets | List of 2-4 related links |

**Example: Table (Quick Start only)**

> ## Next Steps
>
> | Your Goal | Guide |
> |-----------|-------|
> | Full setup | Installation |
> | Add theming | Theming |

**Example: Plain text (single next step)**

```markdown
## Next Steps

Continue with [Basic Usage](./basic-usage) to learn how to use design tokens in your styles.
```

**Example: Bullets (multiple options)**

```markdown
## Next Steps

- Learn about [Theming](./theming) for light/dark mode support
- See [Fonts](./fonts) for font configuration
- Explore [Tailwind](./tailwind) for utility classes
```
