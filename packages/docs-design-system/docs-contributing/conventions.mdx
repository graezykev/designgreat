# Documentation Conventions

This guide establishes standardized conventions for writing overview documentation in the Design Great documentation site. Following these conventions ensures consistency across all documentation.

## Two Documentation Types

The documentation site contains two distinct types of documentation:

| Type | Purpose | Audience | Location |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Integration Docs** | How to _use_ a package in your application | Package consumers | `/design-token/`, `/web-component/` |
| **Development Docs** | How to _contribute_ to a package | Package developers | `/contributing/` |

---

## Folder and URL Naming

Use consistent naming across folder names, URL paths, and sidebar IDs:

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Integration doc folders | `guides/` | `/design-token/guides/`, `/web-component/guides/` |
| Development doc folders | `{package}-development/` | `/contributing/design-token-development/` |
| Sidebar IDs | `{section}Sidebar` | `guidesSidebar`, `componentsSidebar`, `contributingSidebar` |

### Naming Rules

- ✅ Use `guides` (not `tutorial`) for integration documentation folders
- ✅ Use lowercase with hyphens for folder names
- ✅ Use consistent sidebar ID naming: `guidesSidebar`, not `tutorialSidebar`
- ✅ URL paths should match folder structure

### Singular vs Plural

**The noun (subject) determines singular/plural; modifiers stay singular** — like adjectives in English.

| Context | Rule | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Modifiers** (like adjectives) | Singular | "Design Token", "Web Component", "Color Token" |
| **Nouns** (the subject) | Match meaning | "Guides" (multiple), "Development" (uncountable) |
| Navbar labels | Singular | "Design Token", "Web Component" |

**Pattern: `[Singular Modifier] + [Noun matching meaning]`**

| Example | Modifier | Noun | Result |
|---------|----------|------|--------|
| Design Token Guides | Design Token | Guides (multiple) | ✅ Plural noun |
| Base Colors | Base | Colors (multiple) | ✅ Plural noun |
| Design Token Development | Design Token | Development (uncountable) | ✅ Singular noun |
| Font Assets | Font | Assets (multiple) | ✅ Plural noun |
| Installation | — | Installation (single action) | ✅ Singular noun |

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Design Token Guides" (Guides is the noun, plural)
- ✅ "Base Colors" (Colors is the noun, plural)
- ✅ "Design Token Development" (Development is uncountable)
- ❌ "Design Tokens Guides" (modifier should be singular)
- ❌ "Base Color" (noun should be plural when referring to multiple items)
