# Design Tokens Development

This section covers the development workflow, architecture, and guidelines for working with the `@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token` package.

## About This Package

`@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token` is Designgreat's source of truth for UI design tokens. This package owns:

- **Token Authoring** – Design decisions expressed as JavaScript objects with metadata
- **Build Pipeline** – Style Dictionary transforms tokens into consumable formats  
- **Multi-Output** – Generates CSS, SCSS, JS/TS, and JSON artifacts
- **Type Safety** – Full TypeScript definitions for all design tokens
- **Theme Support** – Built-in light/dark theme variants

## For Consumers vs Developers

This section is for **developers working on the design token package itself**. If you're looking to **use** design tokens in your application, see the [Design Tokens Integration Guide](/docs/design-tokens/overview).
