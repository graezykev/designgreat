# Design Token Development

## About This Package

`@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token` is Design Great's source of truth for UI design tokens. This package provides:

- **Multi-Output** — Generates CSS, SCSS, JS/TS, and JSON artifacts
- **Type Safety** — Full TypeScript definitions for all design tokens
- **Theme Support** — Built-in light and dark theme variants
