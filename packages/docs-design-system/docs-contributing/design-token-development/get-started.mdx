# Get Started

Get started contributing to the design token package quickly.

:::info Initial Setup
Complete the [shared setup steps](/contributing#getting-started) first (clone, install, build).
:::

## Package Location

The design token package is located at:

```
packages/lib-design-token/
```

## Development Commands

### Local Development (Watch Mode)

Rebuild automatically on changes (best for active development):

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run watch
```

### Other Development Commands

Build tokens only (quick build, just the token pipeline):

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run build:tokens
```

Full build (includes font download, Style Dictionary, TypeScript compilation):

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run build
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Architecture](./architecture) to understand the package structure
- Start with [Token Authoring](./token-authoring) to create or modify tokens
- See [Publishing](./publishing) for Git workflow and PR process
- See [Testing & Validation](./testing-validation) for quality checks
