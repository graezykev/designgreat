# Get Started

Get started contributing to the design token package quickly.

:::info Initial Setup
Complete the [shared setup steps](/contributing#getting-started) first (clone, install, build).
:::

## Package Location

The design token package is located at:

```
packages/lib-design-token/
```

## Development Commands

### Local Development (Watch Mode)

Rebuild automatically on changes (best for active development):

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run watch
```

### Other Development Commands

Build tokens only (quick build, just the token pipeline):

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run build:tokens
```

Full build (includes font download, Style Dictionary, TypeScript compilation):

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run build
```

## Lint

Lint the TypeScript runtime and build scripts:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run lint
```

## Typecheck

Type check without emitting files:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run typecheck
```

## Test and Validate

### Run Tests

Run the Vitest suite for runtime helpers and validation utilities:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run test
```

### Validate Token Integrity

Execute integrity checks for generated themes:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run validate
```

## Build

Full production build:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/lib-design-token run build
```

This runs the complete pipeline:
1. Clean (`rm -rf dist src/generated`)
2. Build tokens (download fonts → Style Dictionary → generate themes.ts)
3. Compile TypeScript runtime
4. Copy token sources to dist

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Architecture](./architecture) to understand the package structure
- Start with [Token Authoring](./token-authoring) to create or modify tokens
- Follow the [Development Workflow](./development-workflow) for day-to-day tasks
