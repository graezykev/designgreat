# Getting Started

Get the documentation site running locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22 or higher
- **PNPM** 9 or higher
- **Git**

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graezykev/designgreat.git
cd designgreat
```

## Installation

Install all dependencies from the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Local Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/docs-design-system dev
```

This command:
- Starts a local development server
- Opens your browser automatically
- Enables hot reload for most changes

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000/designgreat/`

## Build for Production

Build the static site:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/docs-design-system build
```

This generates static content into the `build` directory that can be served by any static hosting service.

## Serve Built Site

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter @designgreat/docs-design-system serve
```

## Deployment

The documentation site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are merged to `main`. The deployment workflow handles:

- **Automated builds** after successful package publishing
- **Smart change detection** to only rebuild when necessary
- **Unified deployment** with Storybook to prevent race conditions
- **Preservation strategy** to maintain existing content when only one site changes

For detailed deployment configuration, see the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/graezykev/designgreat/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-docs-storybook-gh-pages.yml).
