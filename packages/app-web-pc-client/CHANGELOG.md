### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-web-pc-client
  - Scaffolded the PC client package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and
    typecheck coverage ready.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Wired repo automation so desktop client iterations flow through the same tooling as other apps.
