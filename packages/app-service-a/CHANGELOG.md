# @designgreat/app-service-a

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cdc4da: ## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-service-a
  - Scaffolded the package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace so build, test, lint, and typecheck flows
    are ready.
  - Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
  - Hooked up repo-level automation (husky, commitlint, changeset) to keep future work consistent.
