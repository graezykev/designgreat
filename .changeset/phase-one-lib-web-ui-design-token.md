## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token

- Scaffolded the design token package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and
  typecheck coverage set.
- Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
- Hooked automation and publishing tooling so tokens can version alongside other UI assets.
