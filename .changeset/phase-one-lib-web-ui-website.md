## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/lib-web-ui-website

- Scaffolded the website package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and
  typecheck routines ready.
- Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
- Wired repo automation so site updates flow through the same guardrails as the rest of the stack.
