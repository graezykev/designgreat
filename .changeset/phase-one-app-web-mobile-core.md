## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-web-mobile-core

- Scaffolded the mobile core package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace and aligned build, test, lint,
  and typecheck routines.
- Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
- Wired repo automation so UI work inherits the same quality gates as the rest of the monorepo.
