## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/eslint-config

- Added the eslint-config package to the pnpm/Turborepo workspace so consumers can share lint rules
  immediately.
- Applied the repo's new TypeScript build setup and validation flow to the configuration package.
- Connected automation and release tooling so future lint rule updates publish smoothly.
