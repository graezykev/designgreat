## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-web-pc-core

- Scaffolded the package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and typecheck flows
  prepared.
- Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
- Connected the package to repo automation to ensure core desktop logic ships with the same
  guardrails.
