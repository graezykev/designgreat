'@designgreat/lib-web-ui-design-token': patch
---

**Simplify README for better maintainability**

- Simplified `README.md` to act as a clean entry point with two main documentation links
- Enhanced package description to better communicate the token authoring, build pipeline, and
  TypeScript runtime capabilities
- README now matches the concise, low-maintenance style across all packages

This change reduces maintenance overhead by delegating detailed documentation to the comprehensive
documentation site.
