## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/lib-web-ui

- Scaffolded the UI library in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and typecheck
  tasks ready.
- Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
- Wired repo automation so component work benefits from the same delivery pipeline as the apps.
