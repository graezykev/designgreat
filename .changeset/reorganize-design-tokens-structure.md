Reorganize design tokens documentation structure

- Merged "Package Exports" content into "Installation" page as a subsection for better logical flow
- Users now learn about available package exports immediately after installation instructions
- Updated API Reference category to contain only Runtime APIs and TypeScript Types
- Adjusted sidebar positions to reflect new structure
- Updated cross-references in overview page to point to correct locations
- Fixed component category ordering (Button → TextInput → Dialog) to follow alphabetical order
