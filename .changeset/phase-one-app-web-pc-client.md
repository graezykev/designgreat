## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/app-web-pc-client

- Scaffolded the PC client package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint, and
  typecheck coverage ready.
- Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
- Wired repo automation so desktop client iterations flow through the same tooling as other apps.
