Improved React version management documentation and tooling:

- Consolidated three separate documentation files (dependency-management.md,
  peer-dependencies-guide.md, react-version-update-guide.md) into a single comprehensive guide
  (react-version-management-and-update-guide.md)
- Restructured documentation to prioritize the Quick Update Guide for better usability
- Added industry standard pattern examples from Material-UI and React Router
- Fixed linting issues in check-react-versions.ts script by refactoring for reduced complexity and
  better code quality
- Improved documentation with clearer visual diagrams and faster reading structure
