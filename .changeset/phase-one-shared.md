## Phase 1 foundation for @designgreat/shared

- Scaffolded the shared utilities package in the pnpm/Turborepo workspace with build, test, lint,
  and typecheck flows ready.
- Applied the shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier baselines introduced in Phase 1.
- Hooked repo automation so shared code evolves alongside the rest of the monorepo without friction.
