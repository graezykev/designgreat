**Improve Web Components Guide maintainability**

- Removed "Component Documentation" section from Web Components Guide to avoid laborious maintenance
  as the component library grows
- Added "Contributing to Web Components" section linking to the Component Library Development Guide
- Enhanced "Related Resources" to include Component Library Development Guide

This change eliminates the need to manually maintain a list of components in the overview page,
reducing maintenance burden as the library scales.
